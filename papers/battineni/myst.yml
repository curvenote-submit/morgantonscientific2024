  title: Decoding the Diet of a Local Owl Population
  subtitle: Investigating Prey Composition through DNA Extraction and Analysis from Incisors and Molars of Small Mammals and Rodents
  description: To better understand the local rodent population and its potential for disease transmission, owl pellets were collected from an abandoned building that was soon to undergo renovation in Burke County, NC. Over two years, 12 pellets were dissected, with eight pellets dissected in the first year and the remaining four in the second year.
