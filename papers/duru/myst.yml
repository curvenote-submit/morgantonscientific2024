  title: Using Bromelain Application to Inhibit the Spread of the Tobacco Mosaic Virus and Promote Tissue Regeneration in Red Bell Pepper Plants
  description: Plant viruses are a prevalent issue as they pose detrimental effects on agriculture, the food economy, and numerous individuals worldwide. One major effect of these viruses is tissue necrosis (breakdown of tissue), which plays a significant role in the decrease of crop yields. This study focused on the Tobacco Mosaic Virus, which infects over 350 plant species, causes necrotic symptoms, and exhibits a high transmission rate.
