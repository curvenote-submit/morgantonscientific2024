  title: A Novel Approach to Inhibit MAP2K1 Overexpression Present in Melorheostosis Utilizing Moringa oleifera Extracts
  description: Melorheostosis is a rare bone disorder characterized by a mutation in the MAP2K1 gene in the MAPK signaling pathways, overproducing MEK1 protein, resulting in abnormal, flowing bone growth. Treatment and diagnosis options are limited; therefore, this experiment explores the use of Moringa oleifera, a promising natural product, as a potential treatment option for melorheostosis.
