  title: Assessing the Impact of Water, Algae, Alcohol, and Oil-Based Inks on the Biodegradability of Cellulose in Filter Paper
  description: This study evaluated the effects of several ink types on the biodegradability of cellulose. Paper is one of the main components of cellulosic waste, which is a major environmental problem worldwide. The effects of several ink types, such as alcohol-based, water-based, algae-based, and oil-based inks, on the degradation of cellulose were studied.
